# StrategySimulation

This simulates fleet combat from the game Galactic Civilizations 2.

### Notes

Never add speed to ships.
Always give ships the same priority
Assume 25%, 25%, 40%, 5%, 5% distribution of ship sizes

### Questions to Answer:

1) What priority does a tiny ship have, how do you get that same priority on other ships by using armor.
2) What combinations of fleets might you have at tier 0, 1, 2a, 2b, 3?
3) Do ships from prior tiers remain pertinent?
4) How much collateral damage can you expect against different fleet sizes at each tier
