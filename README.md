# StrategySimulation

This simulates fleet combat from the game Galactic Civilizations 2.

### Assumptions

Never add speed to ships.
Always give ships the same priority
Ship sizes:
    Tier 0: 100% tiny
    Tier 1: 50%, 25%, 25%
    Tier 2a: 0%, 50%, 50%
    Tier 2b: 0%, 50%, 25%, 25%    
    Tier 2b: 0%, 0%, 50%, 25%, 25%        

### Questions to Answer:

1) What priority does a tiny ship have, how do you get that same priority on other ships by using armor.
2) What combinations of fleets might you have at tier 0, 1, 2a, 2b, 3?
3) How much collateral damage can you expect against different fleet sizes at each tier
4) Do ships from prior tiers remain pertinent?
